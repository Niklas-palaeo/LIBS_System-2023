Applying Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and elemental imaging on marine shells for archaeological and environmental research
=============================================================================

This compendium contains the code and data to reproduce some of the figures and statistical data discussed in the article:

Hausmann, N., Theodoraki, D., Pinon, V., Siozos, P., Lemonis,A. and D. Anglos. (2023) [_Applying Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and elemental imaging on marine shells for archaeological and environmental research_] _Scientific Reports_.



How to run
------------------------

I suggest to run the code by downloading the entire repository and executing the steps within the .Rmd file on your own PC. This will reproduce the figures. You can also look into the shell maps in more detail using the shiny-shell [repository](https://github.com/Niklas-palaeo/Shiny_Shell). If you donâ€™t want to run anything yourself, or if there is an error, you can upload the csv files to this [Shiny-App](https://nikhausmann.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Shell/). 

Feel free to have a look around and please get in touch if you have any questions or ideas.
